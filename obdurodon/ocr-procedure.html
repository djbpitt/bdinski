        <h3>The Project</h3>
        <p>Optical character recognition (OCR) for the <cite>Bdinski sbornik</cite> project was
            implemented by Aleksandra Zaytseva under the supervision of David J. Birnbaum. The
            software selected for this part of the project was <a href="http://finereader.abbyy.com"
                >ABBYY Finereader</a>, version 11, which had been employed in the <a
                href="http://suprasliensis.obdurodon.org"><cite>Codex Suprasliensis</cite></a>
            project, as well. The source was Scharpe, Jan L. and F. Vyncke. 1973. <cite>Bdinski
                Zbornik. An Old-Slavonic Menologium of Women Saints</cite> (Ghent University Library
            Ms. 408, A.D. 1360). Brugge: De Tempel. The original typeset text looks like:</p>

        <h3>Scanning</h3>
        <p>ABBYY Finereader can perform OCR on either pregenerated PDF image files or input fed
            directly from the scanner into the software through the TWAIN interface. The latter
            approach, scanning directly into the program from the flatbed scanner, yielded much
            better results. Scans were performed at 300 dpi; we tried 400 dpi in the hope of
            resolving some recognition problems, but we found that the recognition rate at the two
            resolutions was roughly identical.</p>
        <h3>Language settings and the pattern editor</h3>
        <p>The OCR process required us to select a <dfn>language</dfn>, train the system to map
            glyph images to character (code points) in the language, and then convert text areas
            from image to character stream.</p>
        <p>To select and edit the language or languages recognized, go to Tools → Language Editor.
            There you can either select from a list of existing languages or create a new one (“New
            …” at the bottom). To edit the selected or custom language in order to choose among
            available characters or modify the lookup dictionary, hit “Properties,” then the “…”
            button next to the Alphabet bar.</p>
        <p>We initially set the recognition language to Russian (OCS was not an option) in the hope
            that the pretrained knowledge of modern Cyrillic that shipped with the product would
            improve the recognition rate. We found that the difference between the black-letter
            typeface in the input source and modern Russian typography was such that we obtained
            better results starting with a completely clean slate. That is, we created a separate,
            custom language. All in all, we found this more reliable (quicker to train, more
            accurate results) than using Russian or even pre-revolutionary Russian as a preset
            language.</p>
        <p>We found it frustrating that although the Alphabet editing feature permits us to identify
            the characters to be recognized, certain ones cannot be excluded (e.g., Latin “x”) and
            others cannot be included (such as the entire Unicode Cyrillic Extended-B range; <a
                href="http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/UA640.pdf"
                >http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/UA640.pdf</a>). We understand that the use of a
            pretrained language might entail a commitment to a standard character inventory, but we
            see no reason why a custom language setting should not make the entire Unicode BMP
            available. As is, during the recognition process it is not possible simply to copy and
            paste a new symbol into the program (ADD IMAGE). What we did instead was utilize
            placeholders (e.g., <span class="ocs">я</span> for <span class="ocs">&#xa657;</span>,
            which we then replaced with a global search and replace operation after the document was
            saved to a Microsoft Word file.</p>
        <p>The ABBYY program was surprisingly inconsistent, sometimes recognizing a character
            consistently for a while and beginning to make mistakes later. Reading through the same
            page multiple times may yield different results each time. Where the program makes a
            consistent mistake due to a training error, such as inadvertently mapping a glyph image
            to the wrong character, it is possible to undo the erroneous training by going through
            Pattern Editor (“Tools” → “Pattern Editor”). Select the language you’re using and hit
            “Edit …”. A screen of symbols that have been stored during training will open, and one
            can then delete the symbols that are being misrecognized consistently and then retrain
            the page or document.</p>
        <h3>Reading and training</h3>
        <p>After scanning each page we found it most efficient first to delete or edit the green
            text boxes that define the areas to which OCR will be applied. This enabled us to remove
            running headers, footnotes, and other areas that we did not want to retain in our
            output.</p>
        <p>To train, you must go to “Tools” → “Options”, and then check the box that says “Read with
            Training.” This box will uncheck itself after every reading, so you must follow this
            process every time. If you do not, it will read all your pages (or your selected page)
            automatically. This could be an issue if you have already manually edited the mistakes
            in the screen on the right side, as it will revert it to the standard reading.</p>
        <p>If you just hit “Read,” it will read the entire document. To read on selections,
            highlight the desired pages and right-click. To read selected blocks of text, outline
            them with the green box and right-click.</p>
        <p>Training itself is a fairly straightforward process. As was noted above, it is not
            possible to copy and paste new symbols into the Training field, and if there is not an
            option for a certain letter, it is necessary either to edit the range of available
            characters in Language Editor (if permitted), or replace it by employing a global
            search-and-replace operation to post-process the output Word file. If the trainer has
            selected only part of the letter, or more than one letter/symbol, it is possible to
            adjust the recognition area with the help of the “«” and “»” buttons, which can join or
            unjoin what appear to be discrete glyphs (separated by white space).</p>
        <p>After training and reading, letters about which the system is uncertain are highlighted
            on the right side of the screen in turquoise. The user can correct these manually, but
            those corrections are not used to update the training. It is possible to correct any
            character, whether highlighted in turquoise or not, but in general the system showed a
            fairly good awareness of which recognition moments were uncertain, and it proved most
            efficient for us to review on the turquoise sections at this stage. The remainder is not
            error-free, but since the entire output will undergo comprehensive proofreading,
            correction, and editing at a later stage in the development process, we felt that any
            further correction could be deferred until that time.</p>
        <p>One of the trickiest and most frustrating aspects of the training and reading workflow if
            that if a glyph is recognized incorrectly after being read and you cannot just copy and
            paste it (WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?). One way of correcting the error is to retrain the whole
            page, butthis is tedious and sometimes counterproductive in that it may correct one
            error while introducing another. Alternatively, the user can select a small area of text
            to be trained, select “read with training” and right click on that selected text box to
            read only that area. The user can then find the symbol in the given alphabet (“…” next
            to the text box), copy it, close the trainer without saving the pattern, and delete the
            unnecessary text area. This occurred fairly frequently with letters that were adorned
            with diacritics or superscript letters.</p>
        <p>Another frustrating detail is that it is not possible to train the system on glyphs that
            it incorrectly thinks it has recognized. During the training process the system will
            stop and query the user when it is uncertain, but if it is certain but incorrect, there
            is no way to select for training a glyph on which it has not stopped on its own.</p>
        <h3>Saving, opening, etc.</h3>
        <p>It is possible to save selected pages by highlighting them in the left hand side and
            right-clicking. To save the entire project, the user must specifically select “Save
            FineReader Document” under “File.” Likewise, to open a project, the user must
            specifically select “Open FineReader Document” under “File”; simply hitting “Open” will
            open only an individual file, and not an entire project. Saving the project means saving
            the training, so this is an important step if the OCR is not coing to be performed all
            in one session.</p>
        <h3>Recognition issues</h3>
        <p>The following problems arose during the project:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Mistook б (b) for six (6), o for zero (0), and з (z) for three (3).</li>
            <li>Occasionally skipped or inserted spaces.</li>
            <li>Mixed up в and б regularly.</li>
            <li>Mixed up И, Н, and П constantly.</li>
            <li>Mistook “м” for “iл”</li>
            <li>Inconsistently recognized “ы“, often making it “ьi”</li>
            <li>Capitals in general were very poorly recognized. In addition, it would capitalize
                lower case letters and make lowercase letters that should have been
                capitalized.</li>
        </ul>
