# A document has a single <root> element, which contains sequences of <folio> elements followed by a 
# mixture of <line> and <lacuna> elements. The first child of the <root> must be a <metadata> element, 
# which contains the name and email address of the editor (exactly one) of the section.
# 
# The text may or may not begin at the beginning of the page. There is an empty <start/> element
# before the first <line> of the text being edited at the moment and an empty <end/> tag after the
# last line of that text. The position of <start/> and <end/> is controlled separately by bdinski.sch.

# <lacuna> in the old typeset edition has text from a different manuscript, with folio numbers
# and abbreviations, but no superscription or ligatures. <folio> elements in a <lacuna> have 
# roughly the same structure as <folio> elements for the Bdinski sbornik itself. See immediately 
# below for details.
# =====================================================================

# =====================================================================
# 
# =====================================================================
# a <folio> element inside a <lacuna> element is an empty element with an @n attribute. This is the
# same as the structure of a folio element in tbe Bdinski sbornik text, except that column letters
# a, b, c, and d are permitted in addition to sides r and v.

# that occur in the typeset edition are removed from the new electronic text, which transcribes the text

# 
# =====================================================================
# a <line> of the Bdinski sbornik contains text mixed with a variety of elements, some pertaining to the
# manuscript (e.g., corrections, superscription, ligatures, etc.) and some to the print edition (e.g.,
# paragraph and page numbering, which is retained for reference purposes). The contents of a <line>
# are defined in the "lineContent" pattern at the top of this schema file, and the meaning of the individual
# constituents of the content model are described below.

# <supplied> (text added to a line by an editor) may have the same content as a whole line, and the <line>
# element content model is used for that purpose

# numerical value.

  element editionPageNo {
    attribute n { xsd:integer },

# character may have another superscript character on top of it.

# =====================================================================

# =====================================================================
# 
# =====================================================================
# ligatures are entered as a sequence of their components, wrapped in <lig> tags. For example, a
# ligature of "a" and "u" would be encoded as <lig>au</lig>. The distinctive double-omicron (or
# perhaps closed omega) character of the manuscript is encoded as two omicron letters without
# markup, that is, without <lig> tags
lig = element lig { text }
# =====================================================================
# 
# =====================================================================
# <supplied> is used for text that is introduced into the transcription from another source,
# typically another manuscript or by conjecture, where the Bdinski sbornik manuscript is
# determined to be damaged or otherwise incomplete. <supplied> is used for small amounts of
# text, typically within a line; large lacunae are tagged as <lacuna>. If the supplied text
# has a specific source, such as an edition or another manuscript, and was not just invented
# by the tagger, the source should be indicated with the @source attribute. The reason for
# the lacuna must be indicated with a @reason attribute, the only legal values of which are
# 'illegible', 'omitted', 'damage', and 'erased'.

# =====================================================================
# <start/> marks the start of the text and <end/> marks the end. There must be exactly one <start/> 
# and one <end/> element in the document. The <start/> element must be in the first folio, before 
# the first <line> element of the text being encoded (but after lines of the preceding textual unit,
# if there any before the text we are encoding begins), and <end/> must be similarly located in the
# last folio. The position of <start/> and <end/> are controlled by bdinski.sch.
# =====================================================================

end = element end { empty }
# =====================================================================
# 
# =====================================================================
# <subst> is used for scribal correction, and must have exactly two children, <del> and <add>
# (in that order). 
# 
# <del> and <add> may also occur independently, <del> for deletions that are not replaced (such
# as erasures) and <add> for insertions. 
# 
# <add> may record, in an optional @place attribute, the location of an insertion, where the only
# legal value (at the moment) is 'sl' (supralinear). <add> may also record, with a @hand attribute 
# that has the value "other", that the insertion is not in the original hand (the only legal value 
# of @hand is "other"). Text that has been deleted conceptually, but is still legible, may be tagged 
# as <del status="partial">.
# 
# If deleted text cannot be discerned at all, the <del> element must contain an empty <gap/>
# element. @reason, which is a required attribute of <gap/>, typically has values like 'illegible'
# or 'damage'. @extent, which is optional, takes an integer value that records the approximate 
# number of characters missing.
